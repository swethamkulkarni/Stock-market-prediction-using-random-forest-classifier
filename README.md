<h1>📈S&P 500 Daily Movement Prediction using Machine Learning</h1>
This project focuses on predicting whether the S&P 500 index will go up or down the next day, based on historical daily trading data. Using machine learning, particularly classification models, we aim to identify trends in price movement to help with basic market sentiment forecasting.

💡 Objective
To build a predictive model that takes historical S&P 500 data and forecasts whether the market will close higher or lower the next day.

📊 Data Source
Source: Yahoo Finance API via yfinance

Ticker: ^GSPC (S&P 500 Index)

Date Range: Full available history (from 1927 to present)

Frequency: Daily

🛠️ Features
Open: Opening price

High: Highest price during the day

Low: Lowest price during the day

Close: Closing price

Volume: Number of shares traded

Tomorrow: Next day's closing price

Target: Binary indicator (1 if the next day closes higher than today, 0 otherwise)

📌 Steps Involved
Data Extraction

Fetched using yfinance API.

Retrieved the full historical daily data using history(period="max").

Data Preprocessing

Removed unnecessary columns (Dividends, Stock Splits).

Shifted Close column by one day to create the Tomorrow feature.

Created a binary Target based on comparison of Tomorrow vs Close.

Exploratory Analysis

Line plots of historical closing prices.

Target distribution analysis.

Modeling
(This section can be updated once models are trained — e.g., RandomForest, Logistic Regression, etc.)

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
Target variable: Whether the S&P 500 will go up the next day (1) or not (0)

Model Type: Classification (to be added)

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score (to be added)
